# Attribution

ClearToShip vendors and adapts work from other projects. This file records what,
from where, and under which licence.

## Vendored code

### GuardVibe — `src/vendor/guardvibe/`

- Source: https://github.com/goklab/guardvibe
- Copyright 2026 GokLab
- Licence: Apache License 2.0 — full text in `LICENSES/guardvibe-Apache-2.0.txt`,
  upstream NOTICE in `LICENSES/guardvibe-NOTICE.txt`

468 security rules are vendored verbatim under `src/vendor/guardvibe/rules/`.
Each file carries a provenance header. Rule content is **unmodified**; the only
changes are the added headers and an aggregating `index.ts` written by this
project.

Modifications, as required by Apache-2.0 §4(b), are made at runtime in
`src/scanners/community.ts` rather than in the vendored files:

- **27 rules are superseded** by ClearToShip's own AST and schema checks, which
  reason over a whole function body or a replayed migration rather than a fixed
  character window. Running both would double-report the same defect and import
  the less precise location. Each is listed with the rule that replaces it.
- **5 rules are withheld** as measurably noisy in this tool's context — for
  example `VG543`, which matches `; DROP|DELETE|INSERT …` anywhere in a `.sql`
  file and therefore fires on the normal shape of every migration. Each is
  listed with its reason.
- Findings in test, fixture and documentation paths are reported at `low`.

Every vendored finding carries `meta.source: "guardvibe"` and its attribution
string, so provenance survives into JSON and SARIF output.

### gitleaks — `src/vendor/gitleaks/rules.ts`

- Source: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks (`config/gitleaks.toml`)
- Copyright (c) 2019 Zachary Rice
- Licence: MIT — full text in `LICENSES/gitleaks-MIT.txt`

221 of 222 credential detection rules are converted from the upstream TOML into
a generated TypeScript module by `scripts/vendor-gitleaks.mjs`. Rule ids,
descriptions, entropy thresholds and keyword prefilters are carried over
unchanged.

Modifications:

- **Regex dialect.** Upstream patterns are Go RE2. A leading `(?i)` becomes the
  JavaScript `i` flag and `(?P<n>)` becomes `(?<n>)`. 37 rules use *scoped*
  inline flags — `(?i:…)`, `(?-i:…)` — which JavaScript has no equivalent for;
  rather than drop them, the flag is hoisted to the whole pattern. The cost is
  precision, not safety: a prefix upstream matched case-sensitively now matches
  either way, and every match still has to clear the entropy threshold. One rule
  could not be converted and is omitted.
- **2 rules are withheld** as noisy, each with its reason in
  `src/scanners/secrets.ts`: `generic-api-key` (gitleaks' own catch-all — 97 of 118 hits across the
  reference corpus were false, including ordinary arrays of method names) and
  `sourcegraph-access-token` (matches any 40-character hex string, so every
  SHA-pinned GitHub Action reads as a leaked token).
- Per-rule allowlists are not carried over; ClearToShip applies its own
  placeholder, entropy, hex-digest and fixture-path filters instead.

Findings carry `meta.source: "gitleaks"` and the attribution string.

## Services queried

### OSV.dev

Known-vulnerability data comes from https://osv.dev via its public HTTP API —
the same database behind Google's `osv-scanner` (Apache-2.0). Nothing is
vendored and no licence attaches; ClearToShip queries the API at scan time.

This is why the vendored CVE-version rules stand down whenever OSV answers: a
rule that hard-codes "next before 14.1.1" is stale the week after it is written,
while OSV is current. Offline (`--offline`), the vendored rules are the fallback.

## Ideas adopted, code not copied

These informed the rule set. No code, regex or rule text was taken.

| Project | Licence | What it informed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [supabase/splinter](https://github.com/supabase/splinter) | none stated | The vulnerability classes behind CTS010–019 and CTS050–052. Splinter queries a live database; ClearToShip reimplements these statically against migration files. |
| [slopcheck](https://github.com/mattschaller/slopcheck) | MIT | Distinguishing HTTP 451 (pulled for malware) from 404 (never existed) from unpublished-with-installs (open to takeover) — CTS026/CTS027 — and reading install commands out of prose and agent instruction files. |

## Licence status of every candidate considered

Verified against the GitHub API and the repositories' own LICENSE files, because
second-hand licence claims about these projects are frequently wrong.

| Project | Actual licence | Usable in a commercial SaaS? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gitleaks | MIT | **Yes** — vendored above |
| google/osv-scanner | Apache-2.0 | Yes (we use the OSV API rather than the binary) |
| aquasecurity/trivy | Apache-2.0 | Yes |
| dependency-check/DependencyCheck | Apache-2.0 | Yes |
| projectdiscovery/nuclei + templates | MIT | Yes (DAST — needs a running app, out of scope here) |
| zaproxy/zaproxy | Apache-2.0 | Yes (DAST) |
| OWASP/Nettacker | Apache-2.0 | Yes (recon) |
| goklab/guardvibe | Apache-2.0 | **Yes** — vendored above |
| octokit, probot, babel, zod, shadcn/ui | MIT / ISC | Yes |
| semgrep/semgrep | **LGPL-2.1**, not Apache | Only as a subprocess. LGPL is copyleft; invoking the CLI is fine, linking it into the product is not. Its *rules* are separately under the Semgrep Rules License. |
| trufflesecurity/trufflehog | **AGPL-3.0** | No, unless ClearToShip itself ships under AGPL. gitleaks is the permissive equivalent and is what we used. |
| elicosilva/RouteWarden | AGPL-3.0 | Same. |
| wapiti | GPL-2.0 | Subprocess only. |
| sqlmap, nikto | GPL-2.0 | Subprocess only. |
| **Bearer/bearer** | **Elastic License 2.0** | **No.** ELv2 specifically prohibits providing the software to third parties as a hosted or managed service — which is precisely what a ClearToShip SaaS would be. It is not an open-source licence. |
| supabase/splinter | **none** | No licence file means no licence granted. Ideas only. |
| bscript/supabase-exposure-check | none | Same. |

Taking a part rather than the whole does not change any of this: copyright and
the AGPL both apply to substantial portions, not only to entire programs. What
is genuinely free to take is the *idea* — the class of vulnerability, the fact
that a check is worth making. Expression (regexes, queries, rule prose) is not.
