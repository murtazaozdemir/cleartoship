The 2026 @tanstack mass-malware wave, the 2022 node-ipc protestware, and the long tail of post-install crypto-miners all execute through lifecycle scripts the first time the package lands on a build runner — once that command runs, the runner's secrets are reachable. `--expect-provenance` raises the bar further by refusing unsigned packages entirely; pair it with `--ignore-scripts` for packages whose maintainers have not yet published provenance.",
